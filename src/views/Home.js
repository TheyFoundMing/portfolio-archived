          As of now, I'm well-versed with React and Javascript, occasionally
          dealing with Python from time to time. I've dabbled on the backend

          Aside from programming, I like to paint and spend time with my
          recently adopted hamster Jessie. Sometimes, I get homesick and would
          start cooking meals from my hometown.
